## Getting Started
To begin with, I looked at the prototype I created with figma earlier in the semester so that I could recreate it. I created a project in VS Code and added all the HTML pages I needed + a folder for all the image files and a CSS folder with the css stylesheet in it.   

Then I started coding using HTML and styling the website with CSS. This is one of my first times coding a website so I spend a lot of time back and forth between VS code, resources mostly the course modules and MDN.
